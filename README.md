# Data Structures and Algorithms
This repositry contins a collection of different data structurs and algorithms implemented in c++, along with an "allocation-metrics" struct to provide some insight into memory management and memory leak detection.

Each data structure is written using tempaltes to allow them to contain any type needed. Their implementation can be found in the corresponding header file in the include folder (include/queues/arr-queue, for example). The main.cpp file can be used as a testing file to
